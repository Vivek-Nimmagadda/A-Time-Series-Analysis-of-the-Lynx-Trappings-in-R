A Lynx refers to any one of the four species of medium sized wild cat with a short tail that is mostly found in the snowy mountainous regions of Alaska and Canada. During the late 19th century and early 20th century, these animals were highly hunted in Canada for their thick fur which was used in the manufacturing of different items.

The current study briefly discusses the possibilities of fitting a seasonal ARIMA time series model to the lynx trappings data that was collected by (Brockwell and Davis 1991). The data comprises of the total number of lynxes that were trapped annually in the Mackenzie River district of Northwest Canada over a period of 114 years from 1821 - 1934.

A detailed explanation of the analysis is available from Lynx_Trappings.pdf file.
